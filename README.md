# NoteWiz
UB AI Hackathon Project 

🕹️ NoteWiz:
📍 NoteWiz is an AI-powered web application that helps students create and manage personalized study plans. It allows users to input their notes, slides, or any other material to create personalized preparation resources - summaries, flashcards & quizzes.

🪄 Why do we want to create this smart web application?
As students, we often struggle with scheduling or creating effective study plans. Many existing tools lack personalization, adaptability, or AI-driven insights. We wanted to create a smart, intuitive platform that helps students optimize their study plans while staying motivated.

📌 How do we build it?
📍 We built a sleek and intuitive Streamlit-based web application, designed for a seamless user experience.
📍 Powered by Mistral's cutting-edge Large model, our platform leverages the few-shot learning capabilities of the LLM 🧠 to generate highly relevant and dynamic content.
📍 With a strong focus on smooth integration and real-time rendering, we ensure users receive insightful, AI-driven 🦿 responses with ease.
